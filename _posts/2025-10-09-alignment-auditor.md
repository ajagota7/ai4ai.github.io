We're thrilled to share our new paper, **"The Alignment Auditor: A Bayesian Framework for Verifying and Refining LLM Objectives"**! We introduce a novel framework for auditing the alignment of Large Language Models.

## Our Three-Stage Audit Framework

Our framework provides a comprehensive approach to LLM alignment through three key stages:

1. **Recovering a posterior distribution** over reward functions to quantify ambiguity
2. **Auditing trustworthiness** via uncertainty diagnostics
3. **Policy-level validation** of the inferred reward, reframing reward inference as a complete audit rather than mere estimation

## Key Finding 1: Systematic Ambiguity Reduction

We demonstrate that sequential updates contract the reward posterior, yielding **steady AUROC and accuracy gains** on Llama-1B over 5 rounds. This provides clear evidence that we're converging on the true objective function.

The iterative refinement process shows:
- Consistent improvement in reward prediction accuracy
- Reduced uncertainty in posterior estimates
- Better alignment between inferred and true objectives

## Key Finding 2: Trustworthiness Diagnostics

Our uncertainty diagnostics successfully **flag untrustworthy inputs**. We find that reward uncertainty correlates strongly with:
- Out-of-distribution examples
- Ambiguous preference comparisons
- Cases where the model's predictions are unreliable

This correlation allows us to identify when the auditor's judgments should be treated with caution, providing crucial safety guarantees for deployment.

## Implications for AI Safety

This work represents a significant step toward making LLM alignment more:
- **Transparent**: By explicitly modeling uncertainty in the reward function
- **Auditable**: Through systematic validation at multiple levels
- **Reliable**: By flagging cases where alignment may be uncertain

By treating alignment as an auditing problem rather than just an estimation task, we can build more trustworthy AI systems.

## Context-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models for ARDS

🧠 **Improving ARDS Diagnosis Through Context-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models**

Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource for understanding disease heterogeneity and exploring personalization of therapy. Our work leverages these datasets to improve diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

### Key Innovation

✨ **Combines multiple data modalities:**
- Structured ICU data (vital signs, lab values)
- LLM-extracted concepts from clinical notes
- Information from medical imaging

### Results

📈 **Achieves 8-10% accuracy improvement** without compromising interpretability

By using concept bottleneck models, we maintain the ability to understand *why* the model makes its predictions, which is crucial for clinical adoption and trust.

### Why This Matters

ARDS is a critical condition that requires timely and accurate diagnosis. Our approach demonstrates that:
- Combining structured and unstructured clinical data improves predictions
- Interpretable AI models can achieve high performance
- LLMs can extract meaningful concepts from clinical text

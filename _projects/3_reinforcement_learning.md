## Overview

Our reinforcement learning research focuses on learning from human feedback to train AI systems that behave in helpful, harmless, and honest ways. We investigate reward modeling, preference learning, and off-policy evaluation techniques.

## Key Research Questions

- How can we efficiently learn accurate reward models from limited human feedback?
- What are the failure modes of RLHF and how can we mitigate them?
- How can we ensure robustness and generalization in learned policies?
- What role does exploration play in safe RL systems?

## Current Projects

### Preference Learning
Developing methods for learning from pairwise comparisons and other forms of implicit human feedback. Focus on handling noise, ambiguity, and preference uncertainty.

### Reward Model Robustness
Investigating techniques to make reward models more robust to distribution shift and adversarial inputs, including ensemble methods and uncertainty quantification.

### Off-Policy Evaluation
Creating better methods for evaluating policies without deployment, critical for high-stakes applications where online learning is risky.

### Safe Exploration
Designing exploration strategies that maintain safety constraints while efficiently discovering high-reward behaviors.

## Applications

- Fine-tuning language models with human preferences
- Safe robot learning in physical environments
- Multi-agent coordination with human oversight
- Autonomous systems with safety constraints

## Methods & Techniques

- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Inverse reinforcement learning
- Distributional reward modeling

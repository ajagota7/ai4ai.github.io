Welcome to the **AI for Actionable Impact (AI4AI) Research Lab** at Imperial College London, led by Dr. Sonali Parbhoo.

## About

I am an Assistant Professor at Imperial College London, where I lead the AI for Actionable Impact (AI4AI) lab. My research focuses on developing trustworthy and reliable machine learning methods for high-stakes decision-making, particularly in healthcare applications.

My work spans **sequential decision-making under uncertainty**, **causal inference**, and **interpretable machine learning** to improve clinical care and deepen our understanding of human health. I develop methods that combine theoretical rigor with practical impact, ensuring that AI systems can be safely deployed in medical decision-making contexts.

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning & Safe RL**: Off-policy evaluation, decision-focused learning, and safe policy improvement for sequential medical decisions
- **Causal Inference**: Counterfactual reasoning, causal discovery, and causal Bayesian optimization
- **Interpretability & Explainability**: Concept bottleneck models, feature importance, and guarantee regions for local explanations
- **Bayesian Methods**: Uncertainty quantification and robust inference for medical applications
- **Healthcare AI**: Applications in HIV treatment, critical care (ARDS), and clinical decision support

## Background

I received my PhD (summa cum laude) in 2019 from the University of Basel, Switzerland, where I built intelligent models for understanding the interplay between host and virus in the fight against HIV. I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University and a Swiss National Science Fellow. I was named a **Rising Star in AI in 2021**.

My work has been published at leading machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, AAAI) and medical journals (Nature Medicine, Nature Communications, AMIA, PLoS One, JAIDS). I received the **IBM Best Paper Award for Machine Learning in Healthcare** at NeurIPS ML4H 2016.

## Join Us

I am actively seeking PhD students interested in reinforcement learning, causal inference, Bayesian methods, and interpretability with applications to healthcare. If you're passionate about developing AI systems that can be safely and effectively deployed in high-stakes medical contexts, please reach out!
